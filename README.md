## Hair Transformer — Project Overview

Hair Transformer is a Django-based web app that lets users upload a photo and see hair-style transformations generated by AI. The app includes image analysis, hair segmentation, and generated hairstyle previews saved as result images. It was built as a student project and includes demo samples and a lightweight UI for uploading and viewing results.

Features
- Upload a photo and start a head-hair transformation job.
- Background processing with polling for progress updates.
- Face / hair analysis and segmentation (used to generate realistic previews).
- Stores generated transformation images in `media/results/` and user uploads in `media/uploads/`.

Repository layout (important files)
- `manage.py` — Django CLI entrypoint.
- `hair_project/` — Django project settings and WSGI/ASGI entry.
- `hair_transformation/` — Django app implementing upload, processing, and results views.
	- `templates/` — HTML templates used by the app.
	- `static/` — static assets for the UI (images, SVGs).
	- `utils/hair_ai.py` — image-processing / model integration helpers used by background tasks.
- `media/` — runtime storage for uploaded images and generated results (not recommended to commit large files here).
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies (trimmed for CPU deployment; see notes below).

Quick local setup (recommended)
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # PowerShell
# or on cmd: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
# or on Unix: source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Upgrade pip and install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Apply migrations and run the development server:

```powershell
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and use the web UI to upload a sample image.

Environment variables
- `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` (optional) — if not set, a default development key is used (do not use in production).
- `DATABASE_URL` / DB settings — the project uses SQLite by default (`db.sqlite3`). For production, configure a proper DB and update `hair_project/settings.py` accordingly.

Notes about models, large dependencies, and deployment
- This project can use heavy ML libraries (PyTorch, torchvision, bitsandbytes, triton). Those packages may require GPU/CUDA or large native wheels that are unsuitable for small CPU hosts.
- To deploy on CPU-only hosts (Render, Heroku, etc.), prefer pre-installing CPU-compatible PyTorch wheels or trimming GPU-only packages. See the Deploy section below.
- Do NOT commit your `venv/` or any large model binaries to the repository. Use Git LFS or external object storage for model weights.

Deploying to Render (CPU instance)
1. In Render's Service settings, set the **Build Command** to:

```bash
pip install -U pip
# install CPU PyTorch (adjust versions as needed)
pip install "torch==2.9.0+cpu" "torchvision==0.24.0+cpu" -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set the **Start Command** on Render to:

```bash
gunicorn hair_project.wsgi --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

3. Configure environment variables (`DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`, database settings, and any API keys) in Render's dashboard.

If you need GPU acceleration
- Render's standard instances are CPU-only. For GPU workloads you must deploy to a provider that offers GPU instances (AWS/GCP/Azure, Paperspace, Gradient, or a Render GPU plan if available). Maintain a `requirements.gpu.txt` with your GPU-only packages and install it on GPU hosts.

Recommended additional files
- `requirements.cpu.txt` — minimal dependencies safe for CPU hosts.
- `requirements.gpu.txt` — full dependencies including `bitsandbytes`, `triton`, and other GPU-specific libs.

Troubleshooting
- If pip fails during deployment with dependency conflicts: pre-install the CPU PyTorch wheel (see Build Command) before running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- If you see very large wheel uploads or git rejects, remove `venv/` from the repo and add it to `.gitignore`.

Contributing
- Run tests (if any) and follow the project style. Open issues or PRs with clear descriptions.

License & Credits
- This is a student project. Replace with license information if you plan to publish.

If you want, I can:
- Create `requirements.cpu.txt` and `requirements.gpu.txt` now.
- Add a `Procfile` for Render or a more detailed deployment script.
- Add a short troubleshooting section with common Render build log patterns and fixes.
